    <h1>New Physics of Light and Gravity</h1>
    <p>The fundamental components of life are Light and Gravity. Deepening or expanding their theories, even in the form of initial seed points, initiates the development of a new paradigm in natural science.</p>
    <p>The main obstacle to their development, since the early 20th century, has been and remains the hypothesis, authoritatively established by great minds, that Light and Gravity do not possess a structure consisting of particles composed of interacting micro-particles with their own internal structure.</p>
    <p>This hypothesis has two "dimensions." On the one hand, progress is hindered by Einstein’s relativity: light particles cannot have dimensions due to the singularity of lengths at the speed of light in a vacuum. Overcoming such a "barrier" in theory requires a generalization of Maxwell's electrodynamics, allowing all available experiments to be explained without the limitations of previous models. Such a theory has existed in my works since 1986. Its essence lies in introducing a normalized scalar value — the ratio parameter — into the theory, and in generalizing the relationships between fields and inductions, taking into account not only the medium’s velocity but also the source of radiation. In this way, singularities are overcome, and relativistic Doppler and aberration effects receive a dynamic interpretation. The speed of light depends on the velocity of the radiation source, and it is also possible for this speed to "disappear" based on a shift in the light frequency.</p>
    <p>The dynamics of changing light parameters go through stages: its initial stage is described by the Galilean group, while the final stage (not entirely) corresponds to the Lorentz group, which adequately describes the results of interaction. These groups belong to a common family defined by the ratio parameter. It has been proven that such a family defines a Jordan algebra.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, progress has been hindered by the hypothesis that the micro- and macroscopic worlds have no structural analogy: in the macroscopic world, objects have structure, while in the microscopic world, only continuous wave functions are realized. Discreteness is ensured not by structure, but by additional boundary conditions. I have proven that the Schrödinger equation is a consequence of the equations of motion for viscous fluids at very low velocities. Therefore, there is no real basis for denying the possibility of structure within light particles, initiating the study of their components and internal interaction algorithms.</p>
    <p>The first models of light particles were proposed by me in the early 21st century. Their ideology is based on my matrix model of electrodynamics, defined on a pair of unit quaternions. Neutral matrices of dimension 4, with zero total charge, are sufficient to understand the gravitational and electrical neutrality of the proposed light particles.</p>
    <p>The analysis led to a model of light atoms resembling planetary systems. In these systems, a pair of gravitational pre-charges with opposite signs is located at the center, while a pair of electrical pre-charges moves in coordination on the periphery. This model explains many phenomena in a new way: there are no point-like light particles (no zero size), nor infinite sizes (it is impossible to "contain" a very large number of light atoms). The understanding of diffraction effects also changes: they are the result of interactions between the medium and structured particles with a "diameter."</p>
    <p>The differential extension of Maxwell's electrodynamics equations made it possible to construct a system of third-order differential equations and introduce into the analysis not only electrodynamic fields but also a symmetric gravitational tensor.</p>
    <p>On this basis, a hypothesis was formulated about the existence of gravitational atoms in the form of hidden light: in such particles, gravitational pre-charges move on the periphery, while electrical pre-charges are "hidden" at the center.</p>
    <p>This is another world, one that remains completely unknown to us. There is still much to explore.<br>
